# SimpleTVFileRenamer
A simple TV file renamer, this WPF application is intended for people that would like to control how their files are renamed without having to manually enter them via File Explorer.

To run this program, you can download the latest version of either the stand-alone executable or source code zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/iantzoulis/SimpleTVFileRenamer/releases) tab of this repository.

### Typical Use Scenario

It is very common for files to have messy, unclear file names with an array of extra characters and severe lack of whitespace. A typical file might look something like this:

* ```xXThe.SimpsonsXx.1080p.Season.One.Episode.One.Simpsons.Roasting.on.an.Open.Fire.mp4```

To very few this will be an appealing file name. Using this application's parameters, a whole season of files similar to the example can be loaded and transformed to be more readable and organized very easily. Here are some examples:

* Using the season #, episode #, and episode title: ```S01E01 - Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire.mp4```

* Using the show name, season #, episode #, and episode title: ```The Simpsons - S01E01 - Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire.mp4```

* Using the show name, year of release, season #, episode #, and episode title: ```The Simpsons (1989) - S01E01 - Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire.mp4```
